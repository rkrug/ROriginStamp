# Overview
This packages allows to obtain Trusted Timestamps (TTS) from [OriginStamp](https://originstamp.com) for R objects and files. To obtain the TTS, the sha256 hashes are calculated and submitted to [OriginStamp](https://originstamp.com)

## Background

### What are Trusted Timestamps?

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_timestamping)

> Trusted timestamping is the process of securely keeping track of the creation and modification time of a document. Security here means that no one—not even the owner of the document—should be able to change it once it has been recorded provided that the timestamper's integrity is never compromised.

This allows you, "to prove that [you are] the originator of certain information at a given point in time" (from [OriginStamp documentation](https://docs.originstamp.com/guide/#about-this-documentation)).

Examples are to prof that you generated the data at a given time, proof that you had the data before anybody else, etc.

### How is it done

I will cite from the [OriginStamp documentation](https://docs.originstamp.com/guide/#introduction):

> OriginStamp is a web-based, trusted timestamping service that uses the decentralized blockchain to store anonymous, tamper-proof time stamps for any digital content. OriginStamp allows users to hash files, emails, or plain text, and subsequently store the created hashes in the blockchain as well as retrieve and verify time stamps that have been committed to the blockchain. OriginStamp is free of charge and easy to use.

A detailed description on how their approach works, can also be found in [their documentation](https://docs.originstamp.com/guide/originstamp.html#preparation-of-digital-content).


## Prerequisites

Before you can use the package, you have to get an API key from [OriginStamp](https://docs.originstamp.com). For details, see their [Get anAPI key documentation](https://docs.originstamp.com/guide/gettingstarted.html#get-an-api-key).

## Installation

`ROriginStamp` is momentarily only available on github, so you have to install it by using devtools:

```{r install}
if (!require(devtools)) {
  install.packages("devtools")
  library(devtools)
}
devtools::install_github("rkrug/ROriginStamp")
```

## Usage

This package makes it easy to obtain and verify a hashed object or file in R, after getting an API key as described above. 

### Obtain a TTS for an object or file

```{r eval = FALSE}
create_timestamp(
  x = obj, 
  comment = "This is a dummy test for creating a timestamp."
)
```

where obj can be an R object or filename, and the TTS is for the R object or the file the filename obj points to.

### Download certificate for an object

```{r eval = FALSE}
get_proof(
  x = obj, 
  proof_type = "pdf"
)
```

will download a pdf certificate of the R object or filename, while

```{r eval = FALSE}
get_proof(
  x = obj, 
  proof_type = "xml"
)
```

will download an xml file which can be verified using an approach otlined on the OriginStamp website.

# Dependencies

This package aims at minimizing the number of dependencies It has at the moment only three direct dependencies, which are not avoidable as `curl` [@curlR] is used to access the [OriginStamp](https://originstamp.com) API, `openssl` [@opensslR] to calculate the hashes, and `jsonlite` [@jsonliteR] to encode and decode the API communications. The dependency graph looks as followes: 

```{r dep_graph, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# if (!file.exists()) {
  depgraph::plot_dependency_graph(here::here(), suggests = FALSE)
# } else {
```
